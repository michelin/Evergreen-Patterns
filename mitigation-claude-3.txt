Here are the associations between the anti-patterns and the patterns that can help mitigate them, along with brief explanations:

Cascading Failure:

Bulkheads: Isolating functionalities reduces the impact of failures on other parts of the system.
Circuit Breakers: Protecting systems from third-party failures prevents cascading failures.

Big Bang Deployment:

Progressive Roll-out: Deploying systems in small increments enables easy upgrades and roll-backs, reducing the risk of big bang deployments.
Continuous Deployment: Automating deployments ensures they are fast and reproducible, making gradual deployments more feasible.

Change Aversion:

Continuous Architecture: Continuously re-evaluating and adapting the architecture based on production feedback encourages embracing change.
Embrace Failures: Seeing failures as opportunities to learn and improve helps overcome the fear of change.
Hero Problem Solving:

Continuous Knowledge: Sharing and capitalizing knowledge across teams ensures that problem-solving capabilities are distributed.
Application Logging: Logging necessary information for troubleshooting enables more team members to diagnose and resolve issues.

Everything works all the time!:

Accounting for Internal Failures: Designing systems to gracefully handle internal errors prepares them for potential failures.
Chaos Engineering: Voluntarily injecting chaos helps understand the system's behavior and improves resilience.

Integration Point:

Decoupling: Using middleware for asynchronous data exchanges reduces the impact of failures between integrated systems.
Circuit Breakers: Protecting systems from third-party failures minimizes the propagation of issues through integration points.

Overkill Response:

Error Categorization: Using standard error severities helps identify the appropriate response level for different types of issues.
Observability: Setting up golden signals and SLIs enables better situational awareness and targeted responses.

Normal Errors:

Error Categorization: Standardizing error severities helps differentiate between relevant and irrelevant errors.
Application Logging: Logging necessary information assists in identifying and resolving actual problems.
Reactive Operations:

Observability: Proactively setting up golden signals and SLIs enables early detection and proactive operations.
Capacity Planning: Anticipating and forecasting system activities and needs allows for proactive management.

SLA Inversion:

Defined Service Levels: Defining clear expectations of system availability and performance helps align SLAs across dependencies.
Handshaking and Backpressure: Collaborating with third parties ensures they can handle the workload and meet SLAs.
Rushing to solution:

Collecting Evidence: Retaining relevant logs and data during failures enables thorough analysis and informed resolution.
Hypercare: Ensuring all required contributors are prepared and involved during changes allows for prompt and thoughtful reactions.

Snowball Effect:

Continuous Obso Housekeeping: Regularly upgrading components and dependencies prevents the accumulation of problems over time.
Observability: Monitoring golden signals and SLIs enables early detection and resolution of growing issues.

The Blame Game:

Embrace Failures: Seeing failures as opportunities to learn and improve shifts the focus from blaming to problem-solving.
Continuous Knowledge: Sharing knowledge across teams fosters a collaborative approach to incident resolution.

Toil Routine:

Immutability: Ensuring the configuration is 100% defined as code reduces manual tasks and checks.
Continuous Deployment: Automating deployments eliminates repetitive and error-prone manual steps.

Snowflake:

Immutability: Completely re-provisioning the environment for each change ensures reproducibility and consistency.
Ephemeral Environments: Creating temporary and disposable environments reduces the accumulation of unique configurations.

Unbalanced Capacities:

Capacity Planning: Anticipating and forecasting system activities and needs helps ensure resources are properly allocated.
Cloud Native Architecture: Designing systems as independent services enables scalability and efficient resource utilization.

Untracked Operations:

Traceability of data flows: Making data flows easy to monitor and diagnose enables tracking and auditing of operations.
Up to date Inventory: Tracking all assets related to the systems provides a foundation for auditable operations.

Unmastered Systems:

Up to date Inventory: Maintaining a complete and detailed view of system components helps master the systems.
Continuous Architecture: Continuously re-evaluating and adapting the architecture improves understanding and control of the systems.

Unexpected Usage:

Traceability and Usage Monitoring: Providing data that enables understanding of usage patterns helps anticipate and adapt to unexpected usage.
Chaos Engineering: Voluntarily injecting chaos helps uncover unexpected usage scenarios and improves system resilience.
Infinite Resources:

Eco Design: Creating digital applications that improve customer experience while preserving the planet promotes sustainable resource usage.
Continuous Sustainability: Integrating environmentally conscious principles into the system's lifecycle helps manage finite resources.
Procrastination:

Continuous Obso Housekeeping: Regularly upgrading components and dependencies prevents the accumulation of technical debt.
Embrace Failures: Seeing failures as opportunities to learn and improve encourages timely action and reduces procrastination.

These associations and explanations provide guidance on how the given patterns can be applied to mitigate the corresponding anti-patterns, promoting better practices in IT systems and operations.
