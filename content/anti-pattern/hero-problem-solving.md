Hero Problem Solving Anti-Pattern
=====================================

Description
-----------

The Hero Problem Solving anti-pattern occurs when only a select few individuals within an IT team possess the knowledge and skills necessary to address complex issues or problems that arise in the system. This can lead to a situation where these "heroes" are constantly called upon to solve every problem that arises, while others on the team are left with limited understanding of how to address such issues.

Possible Mitigations
-----------------------

To mitigate the effects of the Hero Problem Solving anti-pattern, consider the following strategies:

* **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of system architectures, processes, and troubleshooting steps. This will help distribute knowledge among team members and reduce reliance on any single individual.
* **Training**: Provide regular training sessions for team members to learn about the system and its underlying technologies. This can help build a more knowledgeable and skilled team overall.
* **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration among team members, especially during problem-solving exercises. This can help foster a sense of shared ownership in the system and promote more collective, rather than individual, problem-solving efforts.

Consequences
------------

If left unchecked, the Hero Problem Solving anti-pattern can lead to:

* **Knowledge silos**: The lack of documentation and training can result in a small group of individuals holding all the knowledge about the system, creating silos that hinder collaboration and innovation.
* **Burnout**: The constant reliance on a select few individuals to solve every problem can lead to burnout and turnover, as these individuals become overwhelmed with the pressure and responsibility.
* **Lack of scalability**: Without proper documentation and training, the system may not be able to scale effectively, leading to performance issues and increased downtime.
