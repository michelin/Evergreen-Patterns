# Description

This anti-pattern occurs when systems are designed without considering the possibility of failures or errors. The system is built only for the happy path, where all inputs are valid and everything works as expected. There is no design for failure, no error handling, and no fallback strategies in place.

# Possible Mitigations

* **Error Handling**: Implement a robust error handling mechanism that can handle unexpected inputs, errors, and failures gracefully. This includes validating user input, using try-catch blocks, and providing meaningful error messages to users.
* **Redundancy**: Add redundant components or services to the system to ensure that if one component fails, others can take over its functions. For example, use load balancers, backup servers, and distributed databases to ensure high availability.
* **Load Testing**: Perform rigorous load testing to identify bottlenecks and potential failure points in the system. This helps in designing a scalable and resilient system that can handle increased traffic and usage over time.

# Problem Caused by this Anti-Pattern

The "Everything Works All the Time!" anti-pattern can lead to a system that is prone to failures, outages, and downtime. When the system encounters an error or failure, it may not be able to recover gracefully, leading to lost productivity, revenue loss, and damage to the organization's reputation.
