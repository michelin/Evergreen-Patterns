# Description

The "Normal Errors" anti-pattern occurs when IT systems consistently report a high volume of errors which, upon inspection, are either irrelevant, benign, or unrelated to any actual problems within the system. This situation typically arises from overly sensitive error logging mechanisms, misconfigured alerting thresholds, or poor discrimination between critical and non-critical errors. As a result, teams may become desensitized to the alerts, potentially leading to the negligence of genuine issues amidst the noise. Additionally, it can cause unnecessary alarm and consume significant resources in terms of time and effort to investigate these "false positives."

# Possible Mitigations

To effectively address the "Normal Errors" anti-pattern, consider the following strategies:

1. **Review and Refine Alert Thresholds**: Examine the existing alerting thresholds and adjust them to ensure that only genuinely critical issues trigger alerts. This process involves understanding the normal operational baselines of your systems and defining anomalies with greater precision.

2. **Improve Error Discrimination**: Develop a more sophisticated error logging mechanism that can differentiate between error types. Implementing error categorization or severity levels can help in prioritizing issues that need immediate attention versus those that can be monitored or addressed during routine maintenance.

3. **Implement Error Aggregation and Analysis**: Utilize tools that aggregate and analyze error logs to identify patterns and commonalities. This approach can highlight recurring non-critical errors that may need reconfiguration or modification of the system's alerting logic.

4. **Regular Review of Error Handling Policies**: Schedule periodic reviews of your error handling and alerting policies. During these reviews, eliminate outdated rules, incorporate learnings from past incidents, and adjust policies to align with the evolving landscape of your IT environment.

5. **Education and Awareness**: Foster a culture where team members understand the importance of precise error reporting and alerting. Provide training on the implications of "cry wolf" scenarios and encourage proactive involvement in refining error handling practices.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the occurrence of the "Normal Errors" anti-pattern, ensuring that alerting systems serve their intended purpose: guiding attention to genuine issues that require intervention.
