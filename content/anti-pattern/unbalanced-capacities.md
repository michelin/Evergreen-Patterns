Description
------------

The resources consumed by my system are maladjusted to the tasks to be performed, leading to inefficiencies and potential system failures. This anti-pattern occurs when the capacity of a system's components is not balanced with the workload demands, resulting in underutilization or overutilization of resources.

Possible Mitigations
----------------------

To mitigate this anti-pattern, consider the following strategies:

* **Resource monitoring and planning**: Continuously monitor resource usage and adjust capacity accordingly to ensure balanced workloads. Plan for future capacity needs based on historical trends and growth projections.
* **Load balancing**: Distribute workloads across multiple servers or instances to balance resource utilization. Implement load-balancing techniques such as round-robin, IP hashing, or session persistence to ensure even distribution.
* **Resource pooling**: Pool resources from multiple servers or instances to create a shared pool that can be allocated based on demand. This helps maintain balanced capacity and utilization.
* **Scaling**: Implement vertical scaling (upgrade individual components) or horizontal scaling (add more components) as needed to balance workloads with available resources.
