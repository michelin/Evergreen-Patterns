# Description

In the context of IT systems, "Untracked Operations" refers to the practice where certain actions or operations performed on production systems are not recorded or audited. This might involve configuration changes, updates, or even data manipulation that occurs without any traceability or accountability. Such practices can lead to a myriad of issues including security vulnerabilities, operational instability, and difficulty in troubleshooting or understanding the historical context of the system's evolution.

# Possible Mitigations

To address the challenges posed by untracked operations, consider the following mitigations:

1. **Implement Comprehensive Logging:** Ensure that all operations, especially those performed on production systems, are logged in a secure, tamper-resistant manner. This includes not just changes or updates, but also access logs showing who performed the operation and when.

2. **Adopt Configuration Management Tools:** Utilize configuration management tools that enforce an infrastructure-as-code approach, making all changes auditable and reversible. Tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Terraform can manage infrastructure through code, which is version-controlled, thus ensuring every change is tracked.

3. **Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** By implementing strict RBAC policies, you can ensure that only authorized individuals have the ability to perform certain operations, and all such actions are recorded. This not only aids in tracking but also in enhancing the security posture of your systems.

4. **Routine Audits:** Conduct regular audits of your system's operations logs to verify compliance with your logging and tracking policies. This can help identify gaps in your tracking mechanisms and improve them before they result in significant issues.

5. **Enable Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts:** Use monitoring tools that can track operations in real-time and alert the necessary personnel when unauthorized or untracked operations occur. This allows for prompt investigation and remediation.

Implementing these mitigations can drastically reduce the risks associated with untracked operations, leading to more secure, stable, and reliable IT systems.
