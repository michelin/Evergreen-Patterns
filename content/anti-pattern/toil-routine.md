Description
-----------

The Toil Routine is a set of painful and recurring manual tasks and checks that are required to maintain IT systems in production. This can include tasks such as manually updating configuration files, checking logs for errors, or verifying the integrity of data. These tasks are often repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

Possible Mitigations
-----------------------

To mitigate the Toil Routine, consider the following strategies:

1. Automate repetitive tasks using scripts or tools. This can help reduce the amount of manual effort required and improve consistency and accuracy.
2. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect issues before they become critical. This can help reduce the need for manual checks and allow teams to focus on higher-level tasks.
3. Use version control systems to track changes to configuration files and other assets. This can help ensure that all team members are working with the same up-to-date versions.
4. Implement automated testing and deployment processes to reduce the risk of errors and improve the efficiency of releases.
5. Consider using containerization or serverless technologies to simplify the deployment and management of IT systems.

Consequences
------------

The Toil Routine can have several negative consequences, including:

1. Increased labor costs due to the need for manual effort.
2. Decreased efficiency and productivity due to the repetitive nature of the tasks.
3. Higher risk of human error due to the manual nature of the tasks.
4. Difficulty in scaling systems as the organization grows.
