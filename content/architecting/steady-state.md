# Steady State

## Description
The Steady State pattern emphasizes the importance of creating and maintaining software systems that can operate indefinitely within well-known and rigorously monitored conditions. By adhering to this pattern, systems are designed to sustain continuous operation without significant deviation from their optimal performance parameters. This involves preemptive planning, regular maintenance, and the implementation of mechanisms to ensure the system remains within its defined operational envelope, thereby avoiding unexpected failures or performance degradation over time.

## Key Principles
- **Predictability:** Systems should behave in predictable ways under normal and anticipated atypical conditions.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of system metrics to identify and address deviations from the steady state.
- **Resilience:** The ability to quickly recover from minor disruptions and return to the steady state without significant intervention.
- **Maintenance:** Regular updates, patches, and checks to ensure the system remains in its optimal state.

## Benefits
- **Increased Reliability:** Systems that operate in a steady state with minimal fluctuations are more reliable and trustworthy.
- **Efficiency:** Optimizing for a steady state reduces resource wastage and can lead to cost savings in the long term.
- **Predictability:** Knowing the operational parameters of a system makes it easier to manage and scale when necessary.
- **Simplified Troubleshooting:** With well-defined operating conditions, identifying and rectifying anomalies becomes more straightforward.

## Implementation Strategies
1. **Baseline Definition:** Clearly define the normal operating parameters of the system, including performance metrics and resource utilization thresholds.
2. **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Implement a robust monitoring solution that can accurately track the system's performance against the defined parameters.
3. **Automated Remediation:** Develop mechanisms to automatically correct deviations from the steady state, such as auto-scaling or self-healing processes.
4. **Regular Reassessment:** Periodically review the system's performance and operating parameters to ensure they are still valid and make adjustments as necessary.
5. **Incident Management:** Establish a structured process for managing and resolving incidents that impact the steady state, including post-mortem analysis to prevent recurrence.

## Conclusion
Adhering to the Steady State pattern allows an organization to build and maintain systems that are not only reliable and efficient but also predictable and easy to manage over their operational lifespan. By focusing on maintaining a known and monitored operational environment, systems can achieve unparalleled stability, paving the way for improved user satisfaction and reduced operational costs.
