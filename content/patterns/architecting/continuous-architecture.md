# DEFINITION

"Yesterday’s architecture methodologies and processes will not deliver future solutions" is Continuous Architecture credo. This initiative was launched at Michelin in 2019 and is the umbrella project for the transformation of the architect’s role and the associated rituals and practices.

Operability has a special place in this initiative as a modern Architect responsibility does not end when a product is shipped. Special care needs to be taken to ensure that the product architects design will gracefully handle production hazards, and that architecture runways will be also populated with items that come from production feedbacks and learnings. It becomes mandatory to have a **feedback loop** in place so that Architects are well connected to the production.

There is a lot of existing resource on Continuous Architecture, and this initiative is a key component to design the resilient Information System that Michelin needs.
