# Main Purpose

The purpose of “Embrace Failure” is to take the opportunity of failures to understand, learn and improve.

This can be done at every level: technical, process, organization.



# When to use it?

Embrace Failure is a mindset and can be used in many areas and activities.

An obvious area is the operations: Problem Management is an example of “Embrace Failure” which consists in analyzing incidents clusters or critical incidents in order to find the root cause and fix it.



# How it works

In order to get the best results, it is important to have a blameless approach: the goal is to understand what went wrong, why and what could have been done to prevent it or at least to reduce the impact.

It is important to:

* learn from even small failures as they can lead to prevent greater failures.

* Go beyond the first or obvious cause (you can use the 5 whys or the Ishikawa diagram)

* have a holistic approach: think about the big picture and do not focus on a single level (technical, process, or organization).

# Example

A good example is what is done in the aviation industry when an incident or accident occurs: there is an investigation done by the transportation agency to understand what happened and improve at all levels (aircrafts, tests, procedures, organizations, …).



Another example: if a project rollout failed, it is important to understand why and identify actions to prevent it from happening again.

* If the performances were poor: why did this happen? was the number of concurrent users underestimated? Were performance tests conducted?

* If the application is not adopted by users: is it a training or change management issue? It is do to UI/UX issues? Are there functional issues? And for each case, what could have been done or done better?
