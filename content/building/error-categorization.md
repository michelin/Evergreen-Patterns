# Description

Error Categorization is a structured approach to managing errors within software systems. By adopting a standardized severity level for errors, agreed upon by both the build (development) and operations teams, organizations can effectively classify, prioritize, and address issues. This method fosters clear communication and understanding of error impacts across teams, leading to a more streamlined issue resolution process.

# Key Principles

- **Standardization**: Utilizing widely accepted or internally agreed-upon standards for error severities.
- **Clarity**: Ensuring that the categorization offers unambiguous interpretation of the error's impact.
- **Consistency**: Applying the same categorization rules across all logs and error reports.
- **Collaboration**: Ensuring both build and operations teams agree on and understand the error severities and their implications.

# Benefits

- **Enhanced Prioritization**: Simplifies the process of identifying which errors need immediate attention and which can be deferred.
- **Improved Communication**: Creates a common language for discussing issues between development and operations teams.
- **Efficient Resolution**: By understanding the severity of errors, teams can allocate resources more effectively, addressing critical issues faster.
- **Better Incident Management**: Facilitates quicker decision-making during incidents by providing clear guidelines on error severities.

# Implementation Strategies

- **Define Severity Levels**: Agree on a set of severity levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) and their criteria with clear documentation.
- **Educate Teams**: Ensure all team members are familiar with the error categorization scheme through training sessions and documentation.
- **Incorporate into Logging Frameworks**: Modify logging systems to include severity levels in error logs, making it a mandatory field for error reporting.
- **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review the error categorization scheme and adjust as necessary based on feedback and evolving system needs.

# Conclusion

Adopting the Error Categorization pattern is essential for maintaining high levels of service quality and operational efficiency in software systems. By standardizing error severities, teams can communicate more effectively, prioritize issues based on their impact, and streamline the resolution process. Implementing this pattern requires agreement and collaboration between build and operations teams, but the payoff in improved issue management and system resilience is well worth the effort.
