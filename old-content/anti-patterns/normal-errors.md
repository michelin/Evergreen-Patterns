Observability is a key feature of a system as it allows to get an overview of the system status and detect if anything is going wrong inside the system. Reporting errors allows people operating the system to react as soon as possible thus avoiding the issue and its impact to grow. 
If a system is generating too many errors, likely not filtered nor sorted by severity, the team will be overloaded not knowing which ones are important to be dealt with.  The team will eventually end up considering them as normal errors, ignoring them. This will lead to hide and ignore serious errors which should be dealt with swiftly deteriorating quality of service.
