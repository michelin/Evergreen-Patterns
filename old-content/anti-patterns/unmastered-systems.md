An unmastered system is a system on which nobody have a global view of all the elements that compose this system and how they interact with other systems.  
With this lack of information, any evolutions are complex because it is difficult to know what will be the impact of these changes.  
It will be also complicate or impossible to operate. This can arrive on old system or may be due to another anti-pattern : untracked operation
