It is common that, over time, manual actions are taken to keep systems up and running (purges, checks, stop/starts, daily incidents, ....). Without any deliberate wish, all these routines settle and take more and more time on the team's workload. But habit makes them take hold.  
 
It is important to regularly take a step back to identify these no added value activities. The intervention of an external person acting as a sparring partner may help in the process. For each of them, an appropriate pattern will be found. Starting with the toil automation: time is precious.
