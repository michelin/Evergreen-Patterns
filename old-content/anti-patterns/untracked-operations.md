Even if sometimes it seems to be more efficient to modify directly configuration or code directly on the system itself for a long term perspective this is always a bad idea. This applies not only for the code but also for data , configuration files , etc… 
Whatever the reason, if we don’t know what have been done , for which reason , when , by whom at the end it will be impossible to maintaining consistency of the solution.  
More globally we are talking about configuration management , there is tool that can help you to make changes and deployments faster, removing the potential for human error, while making system management auditable, predictable and scalable.
