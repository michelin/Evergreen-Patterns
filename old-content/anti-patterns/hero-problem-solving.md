It is very convenient to have someone in the team who knows the system very well and is able to rapidly find the issue and solve it. When major incidents happen, they get involved very quickly to fix the issue, and they do. It is however very likely that no RCA will be performed to learn, capitalize and share the knowledge. 
Of course, having people who know the system very well is a good thing, but it is important that the team does not rely on them to always fix issues, thus creating a dependency on them. 
What will happen when those “heroes” will be on vacation or when they will leave the team? 
Therefore, it is important to keep the documentation up to date and to coach team members so everyone can solve most issues and will not rely on a few members. Of course, at the beginning they may take a bit longer to fix an issue, but over time they will improve and solving issues will not depend on a few heroes. This will also highlight any loophole in the documentation that needs to be fixed. 
Automating some tasks can also be very helpful: scripts that fix specific issues or do some checks and can be launched by many people will also reduce dependency on experts.
