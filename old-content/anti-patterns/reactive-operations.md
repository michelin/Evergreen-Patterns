Naturally and historically, the actions of the operations support teams are triggered by an incident opened by a user. This implies that users are already in difficulty in their daily work. 
 
Like firefighting: the team is like firemen who are responding to a fire. They are only called in when it has started and has begun to grow in size by the time they intervene. The observation is that there is always damage (more or less impacting). 
 
And that's the main challenge: as for fires, how can the team enter a preventive mode: detect, anticipate, prevent situations.  The transition from a reactive to a proactive mode is not easy and can be a bit confusing, given all the issues we have to resolve. For it involves greater knowledge of systems, risk assessment capability, tools to improve detection and so on.
