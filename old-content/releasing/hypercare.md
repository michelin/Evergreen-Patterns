# Main Purpose

Hypercare is the period of time immediately following a system’s Go Live or major change where an elevated level of support is available to ensure a good quality of service.

# When to use it?

The use of hypercare will depend on:

- The level of risk of the change: even if extensive tests have been performed before a change, there is still some part of risk that something may not go as planned. This may be due to the system’s complexity, to some differences between test and production environments, to the coverage of the tests, …

- The impact of an issue: even if the risk is low, if the impact is high (financial, reputation, security, …) hypercare may be needed/required.

Hypercare is also an opportunity for build team and support team to make a smooth transition.

# How it works

Before the change, there is an assessment of all competencies needed in case of an issue, then people are identified and availability is organized: some people may be present during the change, some people may be “on call”.

Depending on the change, hypercare can range from a meeting starting before the change and during until everything is checked, to a “war room” that can last until the situation is back under control (for example if a critical application is unstable, a war room may be set up until the situation is back to normal).
