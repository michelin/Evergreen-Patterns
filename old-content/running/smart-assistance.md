# MAIN PURPOSE

The notion of Smart Assistance includes all the technologies that allow to :

* Digitize the relationship with users.

* Allow to bring autonomy by an automatic response to the user.


# GOAL


The gain to look for through these new use cases are:

* An improvement in the Quality of service

* A contextualized, enhanced and in the end, improved user support experience

* A stronger autonomy of users in their work.

* Reduction of the support teams' workload



Tools change the game by addressing the most appropriate team in the support organization to handle the request as quickly as possible.



# WHAT NEED TO BE DONE

Many bot technologies exist. But the work begins with a user mapping. It allows to identify coherent user groups, define their expectation and the appropriate communication channels (a customer centric approach is required -know your users)



After that, the various channels are implemented bringing both new capacity of exchange with users and capabilities of answers automation (link with pattern Time is Precious & Self-Healing).



The implementation must be well designed bi-directional:

* How the user can solicit the support teams

* But also, how the support teams can make information available to users.

At the end, the bot must allow at least

1) to qualify the request,

2) to collect the necessary items

3) to determine and route to the most appropriate team to process it.



Ensure a consistent user experience across all channels.



All actions must be tracked in an ITSM tool to ensure traceability, reporting and analysis.

Most of them use AI and machine learning technologies. This requires continuous attention to the improvement and relevance of the solutions provided.


# EXAMPLES



A coherent group of users working on an accounting process has been identified. To improve their users experience a chatbot was implemented.



This one allows to qualify the solicitations and to answer the question of type How do I. But it also allows

* To answer simple incidents

* Re-initialize the password.

* To have visibility on the next service outage related to a change.

* ....



If the bot does not meet expectations, the request is sent to the support team with the entire history of the conversation for consideration.
