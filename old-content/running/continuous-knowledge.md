# Main Purpose

In order to operate our systems in an efficient way, it is crucial to capitalize and share knowledge continuously.

A clear and shared documentation allows more people to be able to troubleshoot an issue and to do it faster without having to rely on experts.

It is important to keep updating the documentation in time by adding or modifying content related to new or updated features, but also by removing content that is not relevant anymore or by documenting known issues and their workarounds (as long as they exist).



# How it works?

Documentation should be structured and make it easy to find the right information with:

* a clear table of content

* links to other documents or chapters

* keywords or error codes that will help find the information faster



# When to use it?

Capitalizing knowledge should be done during the entire lifecycle of a system, from the very beginning to the decommissioning.

Every time there is a change, it is the opportunity to ask yourself: what is the impact on the existing documentation? should anything be added/updated/removed.

When there is an issue and you do not find a needed information, it is a good opportunity to update the documentation. Sometime even a small detail can make a significant difference in the resolution time.

A good documentation also helps new team member to ramp up faster.
