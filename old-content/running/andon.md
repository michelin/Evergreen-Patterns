# MAIN PURPOSE

Andon is a way of working in an organization through incident alerting, that makes Quality of Service the priority for all, all the time and supports a “Production First” culture. “Pulling the Andon cord” triggers the lightening of a “lamp where people go”, i.e., the incident. Anyone in the team is trusted and empowered to “pull the cord” to prevent an incident getting much worse. Team members take pride by contributing to the Quality of Service.



# GOAL

When an incident occurs in production, all stakeholders ranging from operations to development or SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) are made aware depending on the incident severity. All of them know that they are requested to stop their current activities to focus swiftly on the incident resolution.

Therefore, the Andon way of working fosters focus and active cooperation among the required competencies. Andon keeps the three following Key Performance Indicators at high levels:

* Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

* Mean Time to Repair / Recover (MTTR)

* Customer / User Satisfaction

Andon maximizes the rate of Lean Improvement through Problem Management involving team members from the ground.



# WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE


Implementing the Andon way of working requires solid foundations such as IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and tools, well designed escalation processes through all relevant and well-defined stakeholders, and a crisis management organization in high severity cases.



Beyond usual production incidents, a nice way to train an organization to be “Production First” ready and keep it on its toes, is to implement the “Chaos Monkey” pattern.

Implementing blameless post-mortems after incidents are resolved is key to keep learning and improving.



# EXAMPLES



Many articles on the Toyota Production System are available on the internet for the Manufacturing space. It translates easily into Information Technologies and some big IT companies have instantiated these concepts in many ways and have documented their experience on the internet as well.
