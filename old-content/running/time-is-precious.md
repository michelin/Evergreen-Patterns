# MAIN PURPOSE

Capacity is not unlimited. We need to use the best of the teams' skills. We must ensure that the workload is allocated to the most valuable activities.

In activable solutions, all the automation portfolio takes a major position. But other patterns contribute to this balance (observability, Continuous Knowledge,...).



# GOAL

We cannot speak of a gain but of gains.

This covers several dimensions:

* First of all, the comfort of the teams in order to facilitate the access to knowledge, or the suppression of repetitive tasks.

* A guarantee of quality and quick return for users, thus improving the quality of service.

* A financial saving allowing to invest on the improvement or to allow to integrate new perimeter.



# WHAT NEED TO BE DONE



Take a step back on the team activity on all that is repetitive (regularly, or punctually), all that is time consuming. This can concern complete or partial actions/activities.

Identify the most appropriate solution to automate or reduce processing time.

Implement the solution while keeping the traceability of the actions carried out by the solution.

Ensure over time the relevance and validity of the implemented solution

All actions must be tracked in an ITSM tool to ensure traceability, reporting and analysis.

Note that a use case treated as part of a automation, knowledge,.. approach is eligible for problem management to eradicate the situation.


# EXAMPLES

Any ticket or action requiring a verification in a system managed by another team must be capitalized in a knowledge file in order to treat it in all autonomy.



The actions related to a user access request can be fully automated to provide a reliable and fast response to the request.



The application of workarounds for data correction must be automated
