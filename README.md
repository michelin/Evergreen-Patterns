# Evergreen-Patterns

This project contain the description and documentation of the Evergreen patterns

These patterns are best practices that we encourage team to implement in their context in order to improve the quality of service of their IT systems.

The Evergreen Operability Patterns are composed of 4 families :

- "Architecting Systems" gathers all patterns enabling the design of reliable and resilient systems.
- "Building Systems" patterns are about coding reliability.
- "Releasing Systems" patterns help us secure Go Lives and figure out modernization paths.
- "Running Systems" is the family regarding day-to-day activities for operating high quality services.

This welcome page is a work in progress : useful pointers to start using the patterns:

- Cards are in static/cards
